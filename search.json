Basically, when AI is integrated into a physical entity, it is called embodied AI (AI in a physical body). Examples include a self-driving car, robot, etc. * Physical AI: I see this as an ecosystem/simulation world that mimics the real world. It essentially provides training field for the embodied AI. I also see this as a synonym of digital twin. * Agentic AI: Agent is any entity that can make decisions autonomously to achieve a certain goal. This goal may or may not require the agent to interact with the physical world/things.\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-physical-ai/ * How Does Physical AI Work? * What Is the Role of Reinforcement Learning in Physical AI? * Why Is Physical AI Important? * How Can You Get Started With Physical AI? * Construct a virtual 3D environment * Generate 3D-to-real synthetic data * Train and validate * Deploy"
