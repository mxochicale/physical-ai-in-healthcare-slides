## Key Differences

<div class="column" width="45%">

Embodied AI

<div style="font-size:0.75em;">

- **Definition:** AI with a physical form (robots, self-driving cards)
  integreated into the environment.
- **Focus:** Learning and adapting through physical interactions with
  the environment.
- **Tech:** Real-world sensors and actuators for live perception and
  action.
- **Goal:** To adapt and make intelligence decisions through physical
  engagement.

</div>

</div>

<div class="column" width="45%">

Physical AI

<div style="font-size:0.75em;">

- **Defintion:** Any AI that models, reasons, or predicts aspects of the
  physical world.
- **Focus:** Understanding and reasoning about physical and virtual
  worlds.
- **Tech:** Virtual environments, synthetic data generation, and
  simulation tools.
- **Goal:** To develop models that understand and predict the dynamics
  of the physical world.

\* Embodied AI: This is the easiest one to explain. Basically, when AI
is integrated into a physical entity, it is called embodied AI (AI in a
physical body). Examples include a self-driving car, robot, etc. \*
Physical AI: I see this as an ecosystem/simulation world that mimics the
real world. It essentially provides training field for the embodied AI.
I also see this as a synonym of digital twin. \* Agentic AI: Agent is
any entity that can make decisions autonomously to achieve a certain
goal. This goal may or may not require the agent to interact with the
physical world/things.
