## Key Differences

::: {.column width="45%"}
Embodied AI

<div style="font-size:0.75em;">

* **Definition:** AI with a physical form (robots, self-driving cards) integreated into the environment.
* **Focus:** Learning and adapting through physical interactions with the environment.
* **Tech:** Real-world sensors and actuators for live perception and action.
* **Goal:** To adapt and make intelligence decisions through physical engagement.
</div>

:::


::: {.column width="45%"}
Physical AI

<div style="font-size:0.75em;">

* **Defintion:** Any AI that models, reasons, or predicts aspects of the physical world.
* **Focus:** Understanding and reasoning about physical and virtual worlds.
* **Tech:** Virtual environments, synthetic data generation, and simulation tools. 
* **Goal:** To develop models that understand and predict the dynamics of the physical world.
</div>

* Embodied AI: This is the easiest one to explain. Basically, when AI is integrated into a physical entity, it is called embodied AI (AI in a physical body). Examples include a self-driving car, robot, etc.
* Physical AI: I see this as an ecosystem/simulation world that mimics the real world. It essentially provides training field for the embodied AI. I also see this as a synonym of digital twin.
* Agentic AI: Agent is any entity that can make decisions autonomously to achieve a certain goal. This goal may or may not require the agent to interact with the physical world/things.
